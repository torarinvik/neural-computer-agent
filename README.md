# Neural Computer Agent

A compact research repository for building a real-time neural computer that
learns reusable cognitive primitives from sensory streams and deterministic
outcomes.

Audited model checkpoints are stored in the private Hugging Face repository:
<https://huggingface.co/torarin87/neural-computer-agent>.

The learner receives rendered vision/audio/text streams, its own opaque
actions, its own latent state and memory, and scalar verifier outcomes. It
does not receive game state, coordinates, semantic task labels, rule IDs,
correct-action labels, English chain-of-thought, or counterfactual labels for
actions it did not attempt.

## North star

Maximize verified reusable capability gained per unique interaction.

The project distinguishes:

- unique verifier/reward bits;
- unique logical lifetimes;
- replayed examples;
- optimizer updates;
- GPU and wall time;
- action latency;
- retention and forward-transfer ratios.

Final accuracy alone is not an adequate score.

## Current audited frontier

The two-decision identify-then-act task requires the agent to:

1. emit an opaque probe action;
2. observe its visible consequence;
3. infer the hidden actuator mapping;
4. observe a target;
5. emit the correct opaque action.

The current fresh predictive learner reached on seed 211:

- 100% held-out accuracy at 64 unique verifier bits;
- 100% accuracy and 100% prediction flips under valid protocol rerenders;
- 100% accuracy and 100% prediction flips under target reversal;
- chance performance when the probe consequence is removed.

An incremental 8→16→32→64-bit learner reached 93.36% with 256 cumulative
optimizer updates. A 32-bit arm with 512 updates failed at 52.73%, so extra
replay does not substitute for the missing unique outcomes.

A subsequent exact three-seed map corrected the robustness claim. At 64 bits,
normal accuracy was 55.47%, 99.61%, and 81.64% for seeds 151, 211, and 307;
only seed 211 passed every causal and anti-fluke gate. Thus 64 bits is the
current single-seed capability frontier, not a robust sample threshold.

Earlier fixed-target weights caused negative transfer to the full task.
Inherited weights are therefore retained only when they improve the next
held-out learning curve.

## Setup

Python 3.11 or newer is recommended.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

CUDA-capable PyTorch is recommended for training. CPU and Apple unified-memory
backends are useful for tests and tiny diagnostics.

## Verify

```bash
python -m pytest experiments/forward_transfer_attention -q
./scripts/verify_curated_artifacts.sh
```

The narrow current-task regression suite is:

```bash
python -m pytest \
  experiments/forward_transfer_attention/test_identify_then_act.py -q
```

## Reproduce the current 64-bit task

```bash
python -m experiments.forward_transfer_attention.train_identify_then_act \
  --report experiments/forward_transfer_attention/reports/reproduction.json \

## Next experiment

Two different 32-bit searches are now complete. The feature-interface winner
fell from 69.53% blind accuracy to 55.47% on its replication seed. A subsequent
learning-mechanism population compared a frozen core, zero-initialized residual
adapters, and conservative action/predictor/recurrent adaptation. Its rank-16
adapter reached 66.41% blind accuracy on seed 211 but also fell to 55.47% on
seed 307, with invalid causal reversal behavior. No checkpoint was promoted.

The cheap "more readout capacity or optimizer freedom" branch is closed at 32
unique outcomes. A subsequent eight-clone reward-free predictive-objective
screen also failed: contrastive refinement reached only 58.59% blind accuracy,
and the unrefined core had the best final selection score. Extra auxiliary
prediction losses therefore do not earn a longer run.

The 40/48/56 interval is now mapped across three seeds. The next sub-minute
experiment is a variance decomposition: independently vary predictive-core
initialization, lifetime subset, readout initialization, and readout minibatch
sampling at 48 and 64 bits. Only after locating the dominant source should a
successive-halving population vary that component.

See
`experiments/forward_transfer_attention/ROBUST_SAMPLE_EFFICIENCY_STRATEGY.md`
for the population-search decision and pre-registered diagnostic.

The longer-term optimization is a gradient-trained population with
successive-halving compute allocation. Fitness is held-out learning AULC,
stable bits-to-threshold, retention, latency, and positive transfer to the next
primitive—not old-task accuracy.
